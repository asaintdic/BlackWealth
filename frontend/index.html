    <h1> Welcome To BlackWealth!</h1>
    <h3>Did you know that in 1968, a typical middle-class black household had $6,674 in wealth compared with $70,786 for the typical middle-class white household? And according to data from the historical Survey of Consumer Finances that has been adjusted for inflation. In 2016, the typical middle-class black household had $13,024 in wealth versus $149,703 for the median white household, an even larger gap in percentage terms.
        With this gap getting larger, access to financial literacy resources has never been more crucial!
