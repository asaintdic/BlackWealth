# Topic.create(name: "Generational Wealth", section: 1, title: "What is generational wealth?", body: "It is basically wealth that is passed down from one generation to the next. You may also hear this called family wealth or legacy wealth.
#                If you are able to leave something behind for your children or grandchildren, then you are contributing to the growth of generational wealth in your family. Of course, you may leave many things such as good memories and healthy genetics behind for your family. However, I'm specifically referring to the financial resources that you are able to leave behind.
#                This wealth can come in many forms such as real estate assets, stock market investments, or a financial education to carry forward into the future.
#                The concept of building generational wealth is easy.
#                You simply have to acquire assets or save cash that you don’t intend to spend in retirement. Then you pass those assets along to your children when you pass away.
#                This sounds easy in concept but can be difficult to put into practice. If you are struggling to build your savings, then saving for the next generation can sound overwhelming. And that is completely understandable.", contributor: "Sarah Sharkey", url: "https://www.clevergirlfinance.com/blog/generational-wealth/")

# Topic.create(name: "Generational Wealth", section: 2, title: "What are ways to build generational wealth?", body: "-Invest in the stock market
#                The stock market can be a great way to build wealth over the long-term. If you are aiming to build generational wealth, then it is a great option because it has the potential to continue growing for decades.
#                -Invest in real estate
#                Real estate is another major way to build wealth for the long-term. With the potential for steady cash flows in addition to increasing values over time, real estate can be a reliable path to wealth.
#                -Build a business to pass down
#                Family businesses have the potential for great success. More than 30% of family-owned businesses transition to the second generation. Imagine being able to hand over the keys of a successful business to your children.
#                -Take advantage of life insurance
#                Life insurance provides the opportunity to protect your family in the event of your untimely death. Without your income, your children might be forced into less than ideal financial circumstances.
#                -Invest in your child’s education
#                In many cases, education can provide a way for your children to support themselves. With a college degree, many frequently have the opportunity to pursue high paying jobs that can help them navigate their own finances.
#                -Teach your children about personal finance
#                It is estimated that 70% of families lose their wealth in the second generation. And 90% lose it in the third!
#                With statistics like that, it can seem pointless to save for a legacy of wealth. However, in many cases, the loss of generational wealth can be prevented through financial education. After all, it is easy to lose generational wealth if your kids have no personal finance knowledge.", contributor: "Sarah Sharkey", url: "https://www.clevergirlfinance.com/blog/generational-wealth/")

# Topic.create(name: "Generational Wealth", section: 3, title: "Passing on generational wealth", body: "-Create an estate plan
#                 An estate plan is absolutely essential to securing an easy transition of your assets. The larger your estate, the more complicated this plan will become. At any stage, I would recommend consulting an attorney about how to create your estate plan.
#                -Write a will
#                A will may be included in your estate plan but it is important to create one even if you don’t have an estate plan. The will should include your exact wishes. The more specific you can be about your plans for any assets you have accumulated, the better.
#                -Set up custodial accounts
#                Custodial accounts are important vehicles for any financial legacy that you hope to build. Custodial accounts are investment accounts that you can control for your children until they are no longer minors. In most states, they receive control of the account at age 18, but in some states, they will have to wait until they are 21.
#                -Name beneficiaries for your accounts
#                 If you were to pass away, the beneficiary would receive the funds with minimal effort. It may only take a few minutes to add your intended beneficiaries to your accounts but it can save countless hours for your family later on.", contributor: "Sarah Sharkey", url: "https://www.clevergirlfinance.com/blog/generational-wealth/")
